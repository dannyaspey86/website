   <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>    <p>
    I am fairly happy with the progress so far on my website thing i can get better with a lot more practice and effort on my part,I like the visual studio code because it is the first time I have used it and I am improving all the time i do sometimes forget to add little details which then i can run the command,Trello is easy to use and a good way to keep all your projects in order and sort them neatly i like the adding to rows and marking what needs to be done and what is done very simple programme to use,i also like the slack programme as easy to see what the tudor is teaching.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>

<p> I think the IT tools were appropriate but i can not one hundred percent say yes or no as i have only used this for three weeks,but from the time i have been using i can't say they are wrong as this is the first time doing any kind of coding.visual code is good for the coding as I usually either miss something out or forget to save and then it does not work now if its a thing wrong visual normally will point you out to the part where its missing. </p>

<h3> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>

<p> My strengths of my project are that I can use and understand visual code better than when I first came to code nation I understand on how and where to install my items to code but not always in the correct place ,my failures on a personal note i thought i would understand this a lot better and a bit easier on week three but I still feel in the same position as week one,I am not really up to date on my website as i sometimes forget to add certain quotations or other parts needed for the programme to run correctly.</p>

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>

<p>
    Further improvements I could make to my project try to work quicker using the visual code,understanding of what the various buttons on the keyboard go in a certain order,more improvements would be to try to understand my project more on the basics of how to understand where all my parts for my project go .
</p>
    

<h3> 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>

<p>
    I think with further improvement i will be a lot better at coding & design on my project,and then they will hopefully be fit for purpose,the coding did become a little easier later on in the course and I have improved a lot but not upto the speed of some of the class,it helps me a lot when there is an error  it will direct me to where the error has occurred. 
</p>

<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h2>

<h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>

<p>The benefits of this project is the tools the vs code helps more than if I was doing on my own  as it will point out where the mistake is and sometimes it will help me if I forget to add something that is missing,I probably could have been more efficient when it comes to my website with adding more so it stands out to other websites but I slow learner so not that clued up on this yet but hope to soon.It for me could go either way with working in teams or not,sometimes if not everyone on the same page then not all the team would be at the same level some would be further advanced than others.</p>

<h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>

<p>

    The ways I could improve my improve productivity and efficiency is to work a little quicker on trying to learn what i have to do,may be set myself a deadline to try to meet so it would help me work  a lot better,I think I spent to long on the planning of it and for the research of my images for website and not much in trying to put all my things in the correct spaces
</p>

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>

<p>

    I think I would still prefer to work on my own as I would more than likely hold my team back,Slack is a good place to speak to if you are on a team its way to add copies of your work so other members of your team can see,and if you or them need help it is easy to view to see any problems i never really went on slack really.
</p>

<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>

<p>
    The way to go about testing digital solutions would be if in team you could plan on how the project is going to work,if you are on your own, you would have to do all the testing on your own.
