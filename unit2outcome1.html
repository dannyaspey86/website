<h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>

<p>
    My website contains three pages the main front page is an opening for describing all about me with a picture and  it consists of a pagination for my next pages and it also has an unordered list so that you can clink on the next pages,My first page is a profile of me,the second page will contain my answers to my questions with the layout nearly same as the first place
</p>

<h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>

<p>
    Copyright is different all over the world but will roughly be nearly the same of protecting a product which is copyrighted,it will help the owner of the copyrighted product to keep it their own and no one will be able to copy unless the owner give them permission.copyright also helps if you are the owner of a product they will not be able to display as they will be restricted to do so,intellectual property law also protects a lot of businesses.

<h3>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that 
    people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome 
    them </h3>

    <p>Acesse issues for the disabled to use the web pages are example blind people could use a screen readers which is software that could help them using the website,Unfortunately there are many obstacles that disabled people face when trying to use the website  people who are color blindness may have there own style sheets to override the font or background.some disabled people who have a problem with hearing my use captions for audio content together with amplification of audio and would also use subtitles where possible.</p>

    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>

    <p>
        The best format for file types for my website is png,svg,gif.   Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Scalable Vector Graphics(SVG) graphics interchange format (gif) but there are loads of others that could be used but for me and my website these three are the main ones,Some viruses masquerade as other types of files you should know which file types extensions to be careful of and what to look for as they then can access your computer and do real harm to your website.
